Task: Develop a neural network using backpropagation to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images divided into 10 classes (airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks).

This programs Objective is to build a neural network model, train it using backpropagation, and evaluate its performance.

Dataset used: CIFAR-10 Dataset
